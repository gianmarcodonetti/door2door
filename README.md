## Code Coverage Sunburst

The inner-most circle is the entire project, moving away from the center are folders then, finally, a single file. The
size and color of each slice is representing the number of statements and the coverage, respectively.

## Introduction

**door2door** collects the live position of all vehicles in its fleet in real-time via a GPS sensor in each
vehicle. These vehicles run in operating periods that are managed by **door2door**â€™s operators. An API is
responsible for collecting information from the vehicles and place it on an S3 bucket, in raw format, to
be consumed.

The goal of this challenge is to automate the build of a simple yet scalable data lake and data warehouse
that will enable our BI team to answer questions like:

_What is the average distance traveled by our vehicles during an operating period?_

We would like to ask you to develop a solution that:

1. Fetches the data from the bucket on a daily basis and stores it on a data lake;
2. Processes and extracts the main events that occurred during operating periods;
3. Store the transformed data on a data warehouse. The data warehouse should be SQL-queriable
   (SQL database or using something like AWS Athena).

## Data

The data for this challenge lives on the S3 bucket s3://de-tech-assessment-2022. Inside you can
find:

1. a folder named data that contains all the data;
2. a file named DE_Tech_Assessment_Metadata.pdf that describes the data.

In case you want to use a different cloud provider or develop a local solution you can download the
data from here.
